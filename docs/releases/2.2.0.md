### Breaking changes ###

- [#2168](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2168): Plugable Coins API

  This PR is gives ability gives ability to extend Peatio with new coins implementation.

  Such a big architecture improvements usually brings breaking changes.

  Core Peatio supports Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin(as a plugin) blockchains.
  It means that you need to build custom image if you want to integrate other coins.
  For guide of how to build custom docker image check [documentation](../plugins.md).
  For coin integration guide check **doc/integration.md** of appropriate coin e.g([litecoin](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio-litecoin/blob/master/docs/integration.md)).
  You will find the list of approved coin plugins [here](../coins/plugins.md).

- [#2242](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2242): Reorganization ruby and amqp workers.

  Raw ruby daemons starting script was unified in the same way as we do for AMQP daemons.

  So now to start ruby daemon you need to run the next command:
  ```bash
  bundle exec ruby lib/daemons/daemons.rb daemon_name
  ```

- [#2241](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2241): Major Market model rework.

  This patch makes bunch of changes in Market model and related APIs, controllers and configuration.

  Here is the full list of braking changes for more info check [PR](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2241):

  * Replace Market `enabled` with `state` and list new states (without
  logic implementation)
  * Rework public/market API response structure
  * Rename Market API error name `market.market.doesnt_exist` -> `market.market.doesnt_exist_or_not_enabled`
  * Add ability to disable all markets
  * Remove precision equivalence validation (now amount and price precision could be different)
  * Add precisions sum validation (amount + price precision < 12)
  * Merge min_bid_amount & min_ask_amount to min_amount
  * Update Market seeds
  * Rename ask_precision -> amount_precision, bid_precision -> price_precision
  * Rename min_ask_price -> min_price, max_bid_price -> max_price
  * Rename ask_unit -> base_unit, bid_unit -> quote_unit

- [#2267](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2267): Move slave book from amqp to ruby daemons.

  This PR changes slave book daemon type from AMQP daemon to raw ruby one.

  Now to start slave book you need to run `bundle exec ruby lib/daemons/daemons.rb slave_book`.

- [#2257](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2257): Refactor blockchain daemon.

  Now Blockchain daemon doesn't scaling and BLOCKCHAINS env variable.

  Current version of Blockchain daemon starts separate thread per blockchain which works simultaneously and doesn't depend on each other.
  So it doesn't need scaling to multiple process and BLOCKCHAINS env variable.

- [#2258](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2258): Major trading engine and logic rework with precision, rounding and matching flow improvements.

  Trading engine rework includes bunch of flow enhancements:
  * Remove rounding on order creation
  * Validate volume and price precision on order creation
  * Return invalid_price_or_volume error in case of fractional part overflow
  * Validate Market min_price, max_price and min_amount depending on amount and price precision
  * Market amount_precision + price_precision < FUNDS_PRECISION = 12
  * Set Market FEE_PRECISION to 4
  * Round estimated funds on market order creation
  * Rewrite Matching::Engine from scratch without recursion
  * Update markets.yml.erb with new min_price, min_amount
