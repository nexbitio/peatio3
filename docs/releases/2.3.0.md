  - Improve Market form validations and errors

- [#2292](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2292): Switch to maker-taker fee model. Major Trade model rework

  This patch replaces side-related (buy or sell) with maker-taker fee model. Its basic structure gives a fee discount to market makers providing liquidity (the makers); and charges higher fee to customers who take liquidity out of the market (the takers). Fee could be configured per market.
  Next changes were produced by switching to maker-taker fee model:

  - Replace `ask_fee` and `bid_fee` with `maker_fee` and `taker_fee` in Market model;
  - Replace `fee` with `maker_fee` and `taker_fee` in Order model;
  - Update Entities for Market and Trade models in user API, Trade model in management API;
  - Update Trade Accounting with maker/taker_fee;
  - Update Trade_executor and Matching_engine with new Trade model;
  - Update Market seeds;
  - Specs for maker/taker_fee;

  Trade model rework consist of next changes:
  - Update Trade model structure:
  - ask_id -> maker_order_id;
  - bid_id -> taker_order_id;
  - ask_member_id -> maker_id;
  - bid_member_id -> taker_id;
  - volume -> amount;
  - funds -> total;
  - drop trend;

- [#2347](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2347) Beneficiaries model with ability to manage via user API ([mod](https://github.com/mod))

  Add Beneficiary model which can store both fiat crypto beneficiary data. Custom beneficiary fields like country, account_number, bank_swift_code are stored in JSON format. Also beneficiary contains name, description & currency_id in string format.

  On beneficiary creation pin generated and saved in DB user needs to activate beneficiary with pin sent by email. Create & update actions are published to RabbitMQ by Event API.

  There are 3 states of beneficiary:
  - pending - requires activation with pin;
  - active - activated by user and can be used for withdrawal;
  - achieved - equal to removed except fact that admin can read it.

  Beneficiary account API consists of 5 endpoints:
  - GET /beneficiaries - get paginated list of beneficiaries for user;
  - GET /beneficiaries/:id - get single beneficiary by id;
  - POST /beneficiaries - create beneficiary for user;
  - PATH /beneficiaries/:id/activate - activate beneficiary with pin;
  - DELETE /beneficiaries/:id - delete beneficiary (actually change state to archived).

- [#2355](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/2355): Integrate ability to withdraw both fiat & crypto with Beneficiary model ([ysv](https://github.com/ysv))

  Since we can store Beneficiaries in peatio starting from #2347 now we can
  implement user withdraw API for both fiat & crypto currencies. Itmeans that in
  this patch we have replaced POST accounts/withdraw `rid` param with
  `beneficiary_id`. This change gives ability to use active beneficiaries for
  both fiat & crypto withdrawals.

  `Beneficiary` is now exposed in Admin API as field of `Withdraw` so admin can
  validate it directly.

  `beneficiary_id` foreign key was added to `Withdraw` model so now it has
  optional `belongs_to` association with `Beneficiary`.

  Also this patch improves `Withdraw` `sum` & `amount` precision logic. Instead
  of rounding attributes on creation now attributes precision is validated on
  `Withdraw` creation.

  This patch also adds additional validation for Beneficiary data attribute
